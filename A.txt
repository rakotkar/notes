Dear Sir/Madam,

Application for the role of Java Developer

I would like to apply for the role of Java Developer which I have seen published  on Stackoverflow. please find enclosed my up to date CV.

As you will see from my CV, I have been working as a software engineer for over 8 years now concentrating specifically on Java/J2EE  and I would like a new challenge and feel that I could do the Senior Java Engineer  role that you have got advertised.

I am a methodical but technical person, I like to problem solve and figure things out and that is why I enjoy writing and developing new software as it requires a great deal of thought and logical like solving a puzzle.

I am a very organised and dedicated person to my work, I like to ensure that I meet my deadlines and I usually am working on a number of different projects at any one time. I believe that my time management skills are good and I am a very honest person.

I have enclosed my CV for your consideration, should you be interested in my skills please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to read my application, I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

Rajeev Akotkar
